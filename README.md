kivy-trying-out
===============

Used so I can work across multiple computers.

Since I've lately been hearing about [Kivy](http://kivy.org/#home) more and more and got my hands on an old iPhone 3 I've decided to go have a look at Kivy again. 

I'm a complete beginner here too, but if you can use anything from here, feel free to do so (this repo is not meant as a tutorial, so don't expect the code to be nicely commented, everything to work fine etc.) - I'll primarily be focusing on creating some simple/basic apps and testing out how they work on Android (Nexus 5) and iOS (iPhone 3G).
